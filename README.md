# Estimating-the-size-and-position-of-fishes-using-ECHO-SONAR
Traditionally, a fish population has been estimated by counting the number of fish in a net catch. That is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE AND INACCURATE. A modern and better approach is to use an ECHO SONAR. In echo sonar, sound pulses are transmitted, and the reflected waveform from a school of fish are modeled as a Gaussian random process. We then estimate the number of fish in the vertical direction in the desired range window In this project, a study of this Gaussian random process was made and the results are presented in the report

A sound pulse, as a bunch of sinusoidal signals, is transmitted from a ship. As this pulse encounters a school of fish, it will be reflected by each fish, making the received waveform the sum of all the individual pulses. The many reflected pulses will overlap in time

The study was made on the size and position of the fishes and the model was fitted on a Rayleigh distribution

The code for simulating the variables and fitting the model is present
